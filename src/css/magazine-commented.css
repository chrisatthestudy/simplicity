/*  
 *  ============================================================================
 *  Simple three-section CSS
 *  ============================================================================
 *  This CSS file is designed to be as simple as possible while still giving
 *  good-looking results. It should be mobile-friendly, and is also designed to 
 *  aid with accessibility.
 *
 *  There is no 'reset' section -- the styles modify the browser defaults.
 *
 *  This stylesheet fills the viewport, and is divided into three sections: a
 *  header, a navigation section, and the main page. On small viewports (such
 *  as mobiles) the navigation section will be above the main section,
 *  otherwise it appears down the left-hand side.

/*
 *  import
 *  Import a font from Google Fonts. If you open the font URL in a browser you
 *  will see the complete font-face definition that is being used.
 *
 *  Google doesn't document this on the Google Fonts page, but you can use
 *  the Google Fonts information to find out what the 'family' parameter
 *  should be set to for the font(s) you want.
 *
 *  If you open the URL in a browser, you will see the complete font-face
 *  definition.

 *  font-family
 *  A comma-separated list of the fonts to use, in order of preference. If
 *  a specific font cannot be found, the browser will move on to the next
 *  font. There should always be a fall-back font as the last font, which
 *  should be guaranteed to exist -- this generally means using one of the
 *  default font-family values: serif, sans-serif, etc.
 *
 *  Note that selecting a font is done on a per-character basis. If the
 *  character cannot be found in the first font, the browser will look
 *  through the other fonts.
