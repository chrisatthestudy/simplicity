# Simplicity - CSS Templates

A collection of simple CSS templates, as a basis for different webpage
layouts. These are intended to have no reset section (they derive from the
basic CSS provided by browsers), and to be as minimal as possible whilst still
producing reasonable results.

No divs, no classes. Everything is achieved using standard HTML5 elements.

Each CSS comes in two forms, commented and basic. The commented versions are
not intended for use (and the example HTML files use the basic CSS files), but
are simply highly-commented versions explaining each of the features -- and
how they work -- in detail.

There is also a decor.css which can be included to add some simple decorative
features to the web-page.
